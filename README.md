#Pixy Virtual Screen
Our Team uses the Pixy as a way to cameratrack objects and because it has no live feed we use the variables it outputs to simulate a live feed. Becasue it only uses the variables it gives us it has very little detail. But it is helpful none the less.

## FRC Dashboard
FRC Dashboard is a fully customizable dashboard for [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) which is based on web languages (JavaScript/CSS/HTML). It's completely legal for competition, and can be used to give your whole drive team significantly richer control of your robot.

The dashboard's code is designed to be 100% accessible, tweakable, and expandable. To help in this aim, the code is rigorously documented with thousands of inline comments and [a set of training exercises](https://github.com/FRCDashboard/training). In addition, the base system comes with several functioning example widgets and features, and [many addons](https://github.com/FRCDashboard?query=addon-) have been created to speed up the development of your team's dashboard.
